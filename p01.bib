  abstract =	 {Social Scientists rarely take full advantage of the
                  information available in their statistical
                  results. As a consequence, they miss opportunities
                  to present quantities that are of greatest
                  substantive interest for their research and express
                  the appropriate degree of certainty about these
                  quantities. In this article, we offer an approach,
                  built on the technique of statistical simulation, to
                  extract the currently overlooked information from
                  any statistical method and to interpret and present
                  it in a reader-friendly manner. Using this technique
                  requires some expertise, which we try to provide
                  herein, but its application should make the results
                  of quantitative articles more informative and
                  transparent. To illustrate our recommendations, we
                  replicate the results of several published works,
                  showing in each case how the
                  authors{\textquoteright} own conclusions can be
                  expressed more sharply and informatively, and,
                  without changing any data or statistical
                  assumptions, how our approach reveals important new
                  information about the research questions at hand. We
                  also offer very easy-to-use Clarify software that
                  implements our suggestions.},
